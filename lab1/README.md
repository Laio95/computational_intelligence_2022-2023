# s283816 - lab1: Set Covering

I'm using A* search with cost equals to: weight of the node + missing number to reach the goal

The result are:

## N = 5
weight = 5 with 31 nodes visited


## N = 10
weight = 10 with 481 nodes visited


## N = 20
weight = 23 with 3394 nodes visited

For N >= 100 the the computation was too slow to actually compute a solution
